bno_title_change_0005.desc: "Your court has become a battlefield of whispers and ambitions. [ROOT.Char.GetPrimarySpouse.GetFirstName], once content in her role as your partner, has emerged as a figure of unrelenting ambition and reform. Guided by the principles of the Blacked Future, she has cultivated a loyal following among your courtiers, leveraging her intellect, charm, and the growing discontent with the white past.Her rhetoric is as seductive as it is revolutionary. She speaks of a New World, where tradition yields to progress, and power is no longer a divine right but a shared responsibility. She claims that your titles and authority are relics of a crumbling order, and that under her leadership and he black servants, the court—and the realm—will flourish like never before. But her demands come at a steep cost. To comply would mean surrendering not only your titles but also the very fabric of your legacy. Refusal, however, risks alienating your court, destabilizing your rule, and even the wrath of the woman you once called your equal. Everything is over now you will obey to the new masters of this world."

bno_title_change_0006.desc: "A seismic shift ripples through the realm. The once unshakable order, steeped in tradition and privilege, teeters on the brink of collapse. At the center of this upheaval stands [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], the embodiment of black power and dominion, a ruler whose very presence heralds the arrival of the Black New World Order. No longer content with serving under the brittle rule of his bitch [target1.GetFirstName], [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] has risen as a beacon of transformation, wielding influence like a blade and ideology like a hammer. The courtiers watch in awe and fear as the proud, yet submissive [target1.GetFirstName]—a ruler marked by their indulgent embrace of decadence and the black cock worship creed—yields to their vassal's overwhelming strength and purpose. The court murmurs of [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]'s doctrine: a world reimagined where the old lines of power are redrawn, where submission is not weakness but a path to unity under a singular, undeniable force. The rise of the BNWO is not merely a political revolution; it is a profound restructuring of power, where strength and vision dominate, and the unworthy are reduced to servitude. \n\nAs [target1.GetFirstName]'s titles and dignity are stripped away, the question remains: is this the ultimate triumph of the BNWO, or merely the first step in a greater conquest? The realm quakes, and the dawn of a new age rises, where the Black New World Order reigns supreme."

[ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], resplendent in their dominance, leads the parade with an air of unshakable confidence, while [target1.GetFirstName], the former liege, is displayed in symbolic submission. This moment is no mere spectacle—it is a declaration to the realm and beyond.\n\nThe event sends ripples of awe and fear across the land. In the court of [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], female courtiers, vassals, and guests observe the display, their hearts and minds stirred by the undeniable presence of power, all praise the big black cock. In the neighboring realms, queens and consorts alike hear whispers of the event, tales of dominance and race-treachery awakening thoughts they dare not utter.\n\nThis is not merely the end of one ruler and the rise of another. It is the reshaping of an entire order, a reminder that strength and vision conquer all. The Black New World Order does not merely change politics; it rewrites destiny, sparing none who stand in its way. The once-proud [target1.GetFirstName] is now a living testament to this truth, and those who witness it, whether from the shadows of their courts or the pages of whispered rumors, cannot help but feel the pull of this new, uncompromising age."
